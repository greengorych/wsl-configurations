- [**.wslconfig**](https://github.com/greengorych/wsl-configurations/tree/main/defaults/.wslconfig) - a fully commented default configuration file that replicates the behavior of WSL2 as if no configuration file were present.
- [**wsl.conf**](https://github.com/greengorych/wsl-configurations/tree/main/defaults/wsl.conf) - a fully commented default configuration file that replicates the behavior of individual WSL distributions as if it were the original configuration file shipped with the distro.
