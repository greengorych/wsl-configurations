## Defaults

- [**.wslconfig**](https://github.com/greengorych/wsl-configurations/tree/main/defaults/.wslconfig) - a fully commented default configuration file that replicates the behavior of WSL2 as if no configuration file were present.
- [**wsl.conf**](https://github.com/greengorych/wsl-configurations/tree/main/defaults/wsl.conf) - a fully commented default configuration file that replicates the behavior of individual WSL distributions as if it were the original configuration file shipped with the distro.
- [**cloud-init**](https://github.com/greengorych/wsl-configurations/tree/main/defaults/.cloud-init) - a fully commented cloud-init **default.user-data** configuration file, tailored specifically for WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) distributions that support initialization through cloud-init.
